## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) %>%
  left_join(month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information of the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector
in Baltimore, Maryland. The trash collector will record how much trash
it collects and stores in a dumpster. The dataset provides information
of the year, month, and specific kinds of trash collected. There are
totally 344 rows in the final dataset. There are additional data sheets
that include month precipitation data. The total precipitation in 2018
is 70.33. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

## Problem 2

Read the NYC transit dataset

``` r
subway_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,
                   route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE)
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information about the NYC transit subway stations.
In the dataset, information including lines, routes, stations and their
locations are introduced. There are totally 1868 in the final dataset. I
have cleaned the names of each variable, selected major variables we
want to look deeper, and changed the character input of entry into
logical. I think the dataset is not yet tidy since there are 11 routes
that are arranged in an untidy way.

There are 684 distinct stations in the dataset, and there are 468
stations are ADA compliant. The proportion of station entrances/exit
without vending allow entrance is: 0.3846154

Now reformat the data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables

``` r
subway_df =
  mutate(subway_df, route8 = as.character(route8), route9 =   as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11))

subway_tidy_df =
  pivot_longer(
    subway_df,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    values_to = "route_number"
  )
```

The are 91 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that
serve the A train, there are 34 of them are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

First, clean and manipulate data in pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_month_df =
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "[-]") %>%
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %>%
  left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>%
  select(-c(month, day)) %>%
  select(year, month_name, everything()) %>%
  rename(month = month_name) %>%
  mutate(
    president = prez_gop - prez_dem,
    president = ifelse(president == -1, "dem", "gop")
  ) %>%
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )
